## Buisness Objective </b> 
- Using Linear Regression can we pinpoint the lifetime value of a customer? 
## Project Overview
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website,  The raw dataset can be found on the Kaggle website, 
[here]([https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/renatevankempen/predicting-clv/notebook)). 
- <b>Research</b> 
  -Customer Lifetime Value Prediction( CLV ) value refers to net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. A bank will use different predictive analytic approaches to predict the revenue that can be generated from any customer in the future. This helps the banks in segmentating the customers in specific groups based on their CLV.

## Abstract and Introduction:
- Identifying customers with high future values will enable the organization to keep maintaining good relationships with such customers. It can be done by investing more time and resources on them such as better prices, offers, discounts, customer care services, etc
- Finding and engaging reliable and profitable customers has always been a great challenge for banks. With the increasing competition, the banks need to keep a check on each and every activity of their customers for utilizing their resources effectively.

## Proposed Methodology of Modeling:
- Linear regression is a type of statistical analysis used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship.
